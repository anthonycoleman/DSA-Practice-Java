/**
 * Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges
 * Space Complexity: O(V) for the queue and visited set
 * 
 * BFS explores a graph level by level, visiting all neighbors of a vertex before
 * moving to the next level. It uses a queue to keep track of vertices to visit.
 * 
 * Use cases: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal
 * 
 * Test this implementation:
 * ./gradlew test --tests "BreadthFirstSearchTest"
 * ./gradlew test --tests "com.dsa.algorithms.graph.BreadthFirstSearchTest"
 * ./gradlew test --tests "*BreadthFirstSearch*"
 * ./gradlew test --tests "*BFS*"
