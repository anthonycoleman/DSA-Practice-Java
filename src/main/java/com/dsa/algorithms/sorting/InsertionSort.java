/**
 * Insertion Sort Implementation
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) worst and average case, O(n) best case (nearly sorted)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place sorting algorithm
 * 
 * Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time. It takes elements
 * from the unsorted portion and inserts them into their correct position in the sorted portion.
 * 
 * Test this implementation:
 * ./gradlew test --tests "InsertionSortTest"
 * ./gradlew test --tests "com.dsa.algorithms.sorting.InsertionSortTest"
 * ./gradlew test --tests "*InsertionSort*"
